Notes:

Facebook does not maintain PHP sessions. Instead relies on cookies.

1. When opening facebook initially 3 cookies are created:
	1. datr (HttpOnly) 2. reg_fb_gate  3. reg_fb_ref  4. wd
	
	1. datr seems to be some kind of authentication key or verification key created during opening the site for the first time.
	2. reg_fb_gate seems to hold the current address accessed or simply the home address.
	3. reg_fb_ref seems to hold the referring address. The address is before logging into the account seems to be the reg_fb_gate address i.e the home address.
	4. wd holds the width and height of the screen.
	
2. I deleted the cookies belonging to facebook before login and the login failed.
3. After logging in 11 cookies are created
	1. act  2. c_user  3. csm  4. datr (same)  5. fr (HttpOnly) 6. lu (HttpOnly)  7. p  8. presence (secure connections only) 9. s (HttpOnly) 10. sub  11. xs(HttpOnly)
	
	1. act contains some number
	2. c_user contains user id	
	3. csm contains a single digit
	4. datr contains authentication key but not the same with which i logged in.
	5. fr contains longer authentication key
	6. lu contains yet another key smaller in length (All three seems to be base_encoded).
	7. p contains number 200
	8. presence contains some kind of long key.
	9. s contains another key
	10. sub contains 9 digit number
